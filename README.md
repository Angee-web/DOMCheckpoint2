# DOMCheckpoint2
In this project I created a button that onclick, makes another div change into different colors.
I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
In the JavaScript file, I used the DOMContentLoaded method to let the script run after the HTML has fully loaded.
I used the getElementById method to select the elements that I want to work on.
I generated a randomizer function that generates random rgb code colors that the id if color-box would change into on the click of the change-color-btn button.
I added an eventListener to the change-color-btn element to trigger a function that tells the color-box element to change as soon as the button is clicked.
Finally I added a box-shadow to the color-box element that changes color to the same color as the color-box.
